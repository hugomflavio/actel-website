							<p><strong>Fixes:</strong></p>

							<ul>
							<li>Fix comments not being appended to <code>status.df</code> in the <code>residency()</code> analysis.</li>
							<li>Fix minor bug where comments could not be saved after interacting with the graphical interface.</li>
							<li>Prevent crash in migration if an array has 0 efficiency and there are no arrays coming before it.</li>
							<li>Prevent crash if the dot file/string line breaks are coded as <code>\r\n</code>.</li>
							<li>Prevent crash while printing circular plots for the reports on Macs where the svg engines are not working.</li>
							<li>Prevent crash in residency() if one group has no valid detections at all.</li>
							<li>Fix bug in plotRatios() brought up in issue <a href="https://github.com/hugomflavio/actel/issues/77">#77</a> which would occur when the user specified a section for which not all groups were detected.</li>
							<li>Prevent crashes in residency() when the data has an unusually high percentage of exact-time detections (e.g. midnight).</li>
							<li>Prevent crash if only some tags have multiple sensors and Sensor.unit is only included for those tags.</li>
							<li>Prevent crash if the study area/population is so large that it clashes with ggplot's size limit failsafes.</li>
							<li>Fix message overflow reported in issue <a href="https://github.com/hugomflavio/actel/issues/78">#78</a>.</li>
							</ul>


							<p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>

							<ul>
  						<li>Changed the inner mechanics of the graphical widgets from RGtk2 to tcltk, as RGtk2 is now gone from CRAN. Should not affect user experience.</li>
							<li>Renamed <code>createWorkspace()</code> to <code>blankWorkspace()</code> following cases of confusion regarding function purpose. Closes <a href="https://github.com/hugomflavio/actel/issues/80">#80</a>.</li>
							<li>Removed dependency from package RGDAL; updated distance calculations code accordingly.</li>
							<li>Moved package vignettes to <a href="https://hugomflavio.github.io/actel-website/index.html">https://hugomflavio.github.io/actel-website/index.html</a></li>
							<li>Removed deprecated argument <code>plot.detections.by</code>.</li>
							<li><code>minimum.detections</code> has been replaced by <code>min.total.detections</code> and <code>min.per.event</code>.</li>
							<li><code>section.minimum</code> has been replaced by <code>section.warning</code> and <code>section.error</code>.</li>
							</ul>


							<p><strong>Enhancements:</strong></p>

							<ul>
							<li>Change the behaviour of <code>recoverLog()</code> so it attempts to save the log to <code>actel_job_log.txt</code> if a <code>file</code> argument is not provided.</li>
							<li>Added new <code>force</code> argument to <code>blankWorkspace()</code> and <code>exampleWorkspace()</code>.</li>
							<li>New <code>Code.space</code> column in the biometrics allows the user to specificy the code space of the target tags.</li>
							<li>New arguments in plotArray(): <code>by.group</code> and <code>y.style</code>. See function documentation for more details.</li>
							<li>Include preload() log in reports where preloaded data is used.</li>
							<li>plotRatios() can now subset multiple groups and sections simultaneously. The user can also decide to either colour the plot by group or by section using the new <code>col.by</code> argument (issue <a href="https://github.com/hugomflavio/actel/issues/77">#77</a>)).</li>
							</ul>

							<li>maximum efficiency estimates in residency now only take into account known missed events and recorded events in the denominator (previously, potentially missed events were being included as well).</li>
							<li>GUI interaction mechanisms were changed as a consequence of updating from package gWidgets to gWidgets2.</li>
							<li>The argument 'path' has been removed from <code>explore</code>, <code>migration</code> and <code>residency</code>. The user must now move to the target directory using <code>setwd()</code> before running the analyses.</li>
							<li>Analysis files are saved in a temporary folder and are only made permanent by user request.</li>
							<li>The 'report' argument now defaults to FALSE. By setting 'report' to TRUE, the user acknowledges that a file will be written in the current working directory.</li>
							<li>Auxiliary files to the report are now saved in a temporary directory. The user can still access the report figures by right-clicking them in the html report and saving them.</li>
							<li>actel no longer saves compiled detections to the user's working directory by default. A new argument 'save.detections' (defaults to FALSE) was added to allow users to mimic the old behaviour.</li>

							<li>The possible values of speed.method have been changed to 'last to first' and 'last to last', for a more logical interpretation of the results. The explore vignette has been updated accordingly.</li>
							<li>Separated part of <code>transitionLayer</code> into a preceding function <code>loadShape</code>.</li>
							<li><code>exampleWorkspace</code> and <code>createWorkspace</code> now require a target directory.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>Enhancements:</strong></p>

							<li>Hide biometrics' section from the report if no biometric data was found.</li>
							<li>New <code>advEfficiency</code> function allows user to calculate more robust efficiency estimates.</li>
							<li>Improved release.overview and group.overview objects so they can be used as an input to advEfficiency().</li>
							<li>New <code>plotTimes</code> function allows the user to create circular plots of specific subsets of the time data, with the ability to include night shades too.</li>
							<li><code>getTimes</code> and <code>timesToCircular</code> are now exported, allowing the user to quickly format the input for <code>plotTimes</code>.</li>
							<li>A new page has been included in the vignettes aiming to explore what can be done with the results of actel's analyses.</li>
							<li>Included usage examples on exported functions.</li>
							<li>Verify the names of the release site arrays as soon as the spatial.csv is loaded.</li>
							<li>Added support for timestamps using a "T" separator between date and time in the biometrics and deployments files.</li>
							<li>new 'discard.orphans' argument allows the user to automatically discard all detections that do not fall within receiver deployment periods.</li>
							<li>Users can now create and use a generic detections file. Details for the format of this file are provided in the "Detections" section of vignette 1.0.</li>
							<li>migration() has been upgraded to be capable of handling backwards movements. The status.df has also been improved, and a new graphic was included to the report (last array).</li>
							<li>new <code>plotMoves</code> function allows the user to create personalised detection plots for specific tags.</li>
							<li>EPSGcode argument has been removed from all distances matrix related functions. actel now looks for the coordinate system within the shape file supplied.</li>

							</ul>
							<p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>
							<ul>
							<li><code>array.overview</code> is now called <code>group.overview</code>.</li>

							<li>distancesMatrix will now warn the user if some stations are completely cut off from the rest (i.e. there is no water path).</li>
							<li>Reports are now opened using utils::browseURL, allowing the report to be open even when the computer is not connected to the internet.</li>
							<li>Sensor values are now transported through the analysis and returned in the valid detections (for Vemco loggers only for now).</li>
							<li>Ensure the legend in the residency graphics follows the order specified in the sections argument.</li>
							<li>Improve Thelma .csv file handling for files exported with new column structure.</li>
							<li>Allow for multiple expected first arrays (e.g. if fish are released in a lake whose exits are covered with receivers).</li>

							<li>Prevent crash when loading empty detection files</li>
							<li>Display correct event numbers and names when speed warnings are triggered</li>
							</ul>
							<p><strong>Changes:</strong></p>
							<ul>
							<li>'maximum.time' has been renamed to 'max.interval'</li>

							<li>'tz' is now checked against the output of <code>OlsonNames</code> to ensure a valid time zone is entered.</li>
							<li>messages and warnings are now printed using <code>message</code> and <code>warning</code></li>
							<li>Stop if any of the input files has duplicated column names</li>
							<li>Warn user if success.arrays is not defined in <code>migration</code></li>
							<li>'minimum.detections' is now available in all functions.</li>
							<li>'override' is now available in all functions, and allows the user to directly invalidate specific events.</li>
							<li>'Detections' column in the object <em>status.df</em> (migration analysis) has been split into 'Valid.detections' and 'Invalid.detections'.</li>
							<li>Package-level documentation has been implemented (can be found using ?actel).</li>
							<li><code>explore</code>, <code>migration</code> and <code>residency</code> documentation has been expanded.</li>
							<li>Force all individual residency plots to include all used locations in the caption, to ensure locations always show up with the same colour.</li>
							<li>Stations are now grouped by array in the individual plots, following the array order provided either by the spatial.csv file or the spatial.txt file.</li>
							<li>Improved links between the report plots and the R objects by naming the objects containing the data used in the plots.</li>
